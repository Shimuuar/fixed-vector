2.0.0.0 [??]
------------------
* Type family `Dim` returns Peano numbers instead of standard type level
  naturals.

  - `Index` type class restored and all indexing operation are performed in
  - `Arity` simplified
  - `CVecPeano` dropped and `ContVec` is parameterized using Peano numbers.

* In `ArityPeano` type class methods `reverseF` and `gunfoldF` are replaced
  with more general `accumPeano` and `reducePeano`.

* `Unbox` vector are fully reworked. All uses of data types with `Unbox`
  instances which are defined in the library except `Bool` should work without
  changes.

* `Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont.arity` dropped

* Type of `D.V.F.Cont.withFun` generalized

* Type class `VectorN` dropped. Use QuantifiedConstraints instead

* Show instance now has form `[...]` instead of `fromList [...]`

* `ViaFixed` newtype wrapper for deriving instances is
  added. `StorableViaFixed` is removed

* `Data.Vector.Fixed.Storable.unsafeWith` ensures that pointer won't
  get GC'd while function runs

* `Data.Vector.Fixed.sequenceA` is deprecated in favor of `sequence`

* `foldl'` and `ifoldl'` functions added.

* Implement `sum` as in terms of `foldl'`.

  `GADTs`/`TypeFamiles` are now required to write `Arity` constraint.

  functions are removed (`sequence` & `sequenceA` â†’ `sequence`, etc)
