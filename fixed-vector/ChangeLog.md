Changes in 1.3.0.0

  * Type family `Dim` returns Peano numbers instead of standard type level
    naturals.

     - `Index` type class restored and all indexing operation are performed in

	 - `Arity` simplified

	 - `CVecPeano` dropped and `ContVec` is parameterized using Peano numbers.

  * In `ArityPeano` type class methods `reverseF` and `gunfoldF` are replaced
    with more general `accumPeano` and `reducePeano`.

  * `Unbox` vector are fully reworked. All uses of data types with `Unbox`
    instances which are defined in the library except `Bool` should work without
    changes.

  * `Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont.arity` dropped

  * Type of `D.V.F.Cont.withFun` generalized

  * Type class `VectorN` dropped. Use QuantifiedConstraints instead

  * Show instance now has form `[...]` instead of `fromList [...]`

  * `ViaFixed` newtype wrapper for deriving instances is
    added. `StorableViaFixed` is removed

  * `Data.Vector.Fixed.Storable.unsafeWith` ensures that pointer won't
    get GC'd while function runs

  * `Data.Vector.Fixed.sequenceA` is deprecated in favor of `sequence`

  * `foldl'` and `ifoldl'` functions added.

  * Implement `sum` as in terms of `foldl'`.


Changes in 1.2.3.0

  * Pattern `V1` added

  * `COMPLETE` pragmas added for patterns `V1`,`V2`,`V3`,`V4`


Changes in 1.2.2.1

  * Newtype `StorableViaFixed` for deriving `Storable` instances added.


Changes in 1.2.1.1

  * Fixed bug in `any` (#18)


Changes in 1.2.1.0

  * Support for GHC7.10 dropped.

  * Pattern synonyms `V2`,`V3`,`V4` added.

  * `replicate{,M}` and `generate{,M}` added.

  * Functions `mk6`, `mk7`, `mk8` added.


Changes in 1.2.0.0

  * `Show` instance for data type now respect precedence.

Changes in 1.1.0.0

  * GHC8.4 compatibility release. Semigroup instances added and
    semigroup dependency added for GHC7.10

Changes in 1.0.0.0

  * Vector length now expressed as GHC's type level literals. Underlying
    implementation still uses Peano numbers to perform induction. This doesn't
    change user facing API much. Notably `FlexibleInstances` and
    `GADTs`/`TypeFamiles` are now required to write `Arity` constraint.

  * `Monad` constraint is relaxed to `Applicative` where applicable. Duplicate
    functions are removed (`sequence` & `sequenceA` â†’ `sequence`, etc)

  * Module `Data.Vector.Fixed.Monomorphic` is dropped.

  * Construction of N-ary vectors reworked. `Make` type class is gone.

  * Boxed arrays now use SmallArrays internally.

  * `overlaps` is removed from API for mutable vectors.

  * `Data.Vector.Fixed.defaultRnf` is added.

  * `Data.Vector.Fixed.Mutable.lengthI` is dropped.

Changes in 0.9.0.0

  * Simplification of `Arity` type class. This change shouldn't affect client
    code.

  * Support for GHC < 7.8 is droppped.

  * Fixed bug in `any`.


Changes in 0.8.1.0

  * `find` function added.


Changes in 0.8.0.0

  * NFData instances for all data type.
