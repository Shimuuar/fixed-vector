Name:           fixed-vector
Version:        1.2.1.1
Synopsis:       Generic vectors with statically known size.
Description:
  Generic library for vectors with statically known
  size. Implementation is based on
  <http://unlines.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/generics-for-small-fixed-size-vectors/>
  Same functions could be used to work with both ADT based vector like
  .
  > data Vec3 a = a a a
  .
  Tuples are vectors too:
  .
  >>> sum (1,2,3)
  6
  .
  Vectors which are represented internally by arrays are provided by
  library. Both boxed and unboxed arrays are supported.
  .
  Library is structured as follows:
  .
  * Data.Vector.Fixed
  Generic API. It's suitable for both ADT-based vector like Complex
  and array-based ones.
  .
  * Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont
  Continuation based vectors. Internally all functions use them.
  .
  * Data.Vector.Fixed.Mutable
  Type classes for array-based implementation and API for working with
  mutable state.
  .
  * Data.Vector.Fixed.Unboxed
  Unboxed vectors.
  .
  * Data.Vector.Fixed.Boxed
  Boxed vector which can hold elements of any type.
  .
  * Data.Vector.Fixed.Storable
  Unboxed vectors of Storable  types.
  .
  * Data.Vector.Fixed.Primitive
  Unboxed vectors based on pritimive package.
